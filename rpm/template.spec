%description
This stack provides Python bindings for Qt. There are two providers: pyside and
pyqt. PySide2 is available under the GPL, LGPL and a commercial license. PyQt is
released under the GPL. Both the bindings and tools to build bindings are
included from each available provider. For PySide, it is called
&quot;Shiboken&quot;. For PyQt, this is called &quot;SIP&quot;. Also provided is
adapter code to make the user's Python code independent of which binding
provider was actually used which makes it very easy to switch between these.
